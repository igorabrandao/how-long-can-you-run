To do so, he's been training constantly and keeping record of many aspects of his training practices with the help of an app. For this purpose, he needs to do a survey with all the information his app's been collecting, and what does he need to improve i order to get a gold medal. Unfortunately, we are yet to discover a way to work out in one day and to wake up in the next morning just like Hulk. It takes a very very looooong time to achieve the wanted results, but with time and dedication it will eventually happen. So Ivano counts on you to analyse the data survey of his last month training practices and also to know what is still necessary to improve so he can achieve his goals. So, hands on!

But to do so, you must first learn how to select specific rows and columns, so that you can perform operations on them. Fortunately, **pandas** provides many ways to do this kind of selection, and we're going to help you understand a few of them.\n","\n","As we've already mentioned, you can check the different columns of your dataframe by accessing them with the **DataFrame.columns** attribute. It turns out that these columns are also attributes of your dataframe, and they can be accessed by using this very simple syntax.\n","\n","```python\n","totalCalories = runningData.total_calories\n","```\n","\n","Another way to do this would be to used the column's name as an index, just like this:\n","\n","```python\n","totalCalories = runningData[\"total_calories\"]\n","```\n","\n","When you select a single column from a dataframe and assign it to a variable, this column will be assigned to a **Series** type of object. You can verify this by using the **type** function. The main difference between **Series** and **Dataframes** is that **Series** are one-dimensional labeled arrays, whereas **Dataframes** are bidmensional collections of one or more **Series**, and are usually labeled by column names.\n","\n","Even though selecting single columns is useful, most of the time you will need more than this to effectively manipulate your data, so **pandas** provides a method called  [DataFrame.loc[]](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html#pandas.DataFrame.loc). You should have noticed that unlike the other methods we've seen so far, **loc** uses brackets (**[]**) instead of parenthesis (**()**). This is probably because it is used for selection, so **pandas** provides us with a more intuitive syntax, considering brackets are used for selection all over the other programming languages.\n","\n","There are many ways to use **loc** for selection, we're going to show you a few of them in this section and we might come back to this subject if needed. For starters, the usual workflow for using **loc** is by using the following syntax:\n","\n","```python\n","runningData.loc[row, column]\n","```\n","In this syntax, row and columns stand for rows and columns labels. These can be specified in many ways, **pandas** provides us with a lot of options to select our rows and columns, and these options influence directly on the kind of input you are going to get, specially for the way you specify the wanted columns.\n","\n","If you pass a single column to the **column** parameters, the **loc** method will return a single **Series** type of object containing all the values for the specified column.\n","\n","```python\n","runningData.loc[row, \"column_name\"]\n","```\n","\n","On the other hand, if you use the following syntax:\n","\n","```python\n","runningData.loc[row, [\"column_a\", \"column_b\"]]\n","```\n","\n","**Pandas** will return a **Dataframe** containing all specified rows and specified columns in the order of input. As you can see, the columns are passed as a list, so you can pass as many columns as you want in whatever order you wish.\n","\n","Yet another way to select data is by using the split syntax:\n","\n","```python\n","runningData.loc[row, \"column_a\":\"column_b\"]\n","```\n","\n","As expected, using **loc** with the split syntax will return a **Dataframe** with all the specified rows and columns between *column_a* and *column_b* (inclusive).\n","\n","Now that you know how to select specific data from your dataset, you can use your newly acquired skills to help Ivano separate different values from the dataset so that they can be cleaned or processed. This will be a huge help, since some data is unneeded and he currently finds the dataset too complicated to understand.

So let's say we wanted to select all rows of the dataset whose **type** column has the value *Cycling*. One way to do this would be to loop through all the rows in the dataset and select only the ones we're interested in, but this method is hacky and too expensive for large datasets. The best way to do this would be to use **boolean indexing**, which is a lot cleaner and benefits from **pandas** vectorization, a mechanism that **pandas** uses to speed up operations.\n","\n","So for instance, if we wanted to select only rows from the dataset whose **column_name** column has the *\"val\"* value,  we could use **boolean indexing** by following this syntax:\n","\n","```python\n","typeBool = runningData[\"column_name\"] == \"val\"\n","runningData.loc[typeBool, :]\n","```\n","\n","Alternatively, everytime you use **DataFrame.loc**, if you are specifying only rows and selecting all columns or the other way around, you could use this simplified syntax:\n","\n","```python\n","typeBool = runningData[\"column_name\"] == \"val\"\n","runningData.loc[typeBool]\n","runningData.loc[[\"column_a\", \"column_b\"]]\n","```\n","\n","Now that you know how to select specific values from the dataset, it would be a good idea to select only the relevant values for Ivano's cycling marathon.

What's cool about **NumPy** operations with **pandas** is that they have the same syntax for both **Dataframes** and **Series**, so you don't have to worry about memorizing different syntax. The most commonly used operations are:\n","\n","- [Series.max()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.max.html) and [DataFrame.max()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.max.html), which returns the greatest element(s) in the object.\n","- [Series.min()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.min.html) and [DataFrame.min()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.min.html), returns the smallest element(s) in the object.\n","- [Series.mean()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.mean.html) and [DataFrame.mean()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.mean.html), returns the mean for the elements.\n","- [Series.median()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.median.html) and [DataFrame.median()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.median.html), returns the median for the elements.\n","- [Series.sum()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.sum.html) and [DataFrame.sum()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.sum.html), returns the sum for the elements.\n","\n","You probably noticed that the methods are very intuitive, they do exactly what their name suggests. The main difference between using **NumPy** methos for **Dataframes** and **Series** is that in the former, you can specify an **axis** parameters.
